  ## Description
 The purpose of this project was to build an application that generated a readme file based on a prompt answered by a user. This project helped apply my knowledge on the general concepts  of node.js, the inquirer module, the read and write system of node, and general ES6 features. This application was made solely with the use of node.js and javascript.

  ## Installation
 In order to install this application, the user would have to clone the repo and move to the develop folder of the repo. From there, they would use the command "npm install" in the terminal in order to install inquirer.

  ## Usage
 To use the application, make sure you are in the develop folder. From there, type the command "node.index.js" in the terminal. A series of prompts will show up in the terminal for you to answer. After the prompt has been answered, a readme file should be created in the repo folder. Reusing the application will overwrite the readme file if there is already one in the repo folder.
